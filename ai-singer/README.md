# MEHRAN Self-Hosted Singing Engine

This directory contains the first backend foundation for MEHRAN's own singing-voice system. It is deliberately honest about the current capability boundary.

## Current status

- Job intake and structural validation: implemented.
- Standard MIDI format 0/1 parsing: implemented for PPQ timing, note events, and tempo maps.
- MIDI analysis endpoint: implemented; returns note names, pitch, beat positions, seconds, tempo map, and duration.
- Persian lyrics are preserved as Unicode; only basic whitespace word counting is provided.
- Persian phoneme conversion, syllable segmentation, and lyric-to-note alignment: **not implemented**.
- Singing inference / WAV generation: **not implemented**.
- No third-party generation API is called.
- No model weights or GPU deployment are included.

The API reports `generation_ready: false`. Successful validation or MIDI analysis is not a generated vocal.

## Run locally

Python 3.10+ is recommended.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Open `/docs` for API documentation and `/health` for capability status.

## API

- `GET /health`: service and model readiness.
- `POST /v1/jobs/validate`: validates a `mehran.svs.job.v1` job; does not synthesize.
- `POST /v1/jobs/analyze`: parses an attached MIDI file and returns a tempo-aware note timeline; does not synthesize or align lyrics.

## MIDI parser limits

Supports Standard MIDI File format 0 and 1, PPQ timing, channel note-on/note-off events, running status, and tempo meta-events. SMPTE division, format 2, and unsupported system-common events are rejected. Unmatched note-ons are not treated as completed notes. The parser caps output at 4096 note events.

## Next engineering milestones

1. Add deterministic Persian text normalization and tested syllable/phoneme segmentation.
2. Align reviewed syllables to the MIDI note timeline, with manual correction support.
3. Define the internal acoustic model interface and training-data manifest.
4. Train/evaluate a Persian-capable singing model.
5. Implement inference, vocal stem rendering, deterministic job tracking and audio quality tests.
6. Deploy on MEHRAN-controlled compute, then connect the studio UI.

Do not label this scaffold as an AI singer or use it to claim that a vocal WAV can already be generated.
